# HTMLaunchpad
A Launchpad but in the browser


To use the keyboard, hold down Alt + the letter/number that is on the tile.

# NOTES

1. I have only tested this on Chrome, so there is no definitive list as to where this web app will work
2. Before using, some keyboard combinations used to trigger buttons may trigger built in shortcuts on Chrome. My solution to this was to install Shortkeys here (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shortkeys-custom-keyboard/logpjaacgmcbpdkdchjiaagddngobkck) and follow this tutorial (https://www.addictivetips.com/web/disable-a-chrome-keyboard-shortcut/#:~:text=To%20disable%20a%20keyboard%20shortcut,Options%20from%20the%20context%20menu.) on how to disable chrome shortcuts. If you plan on using keys for this, I recommend setting up the extension and disabling certain shortcuts to ensure the best experience while using HTMLaunchpad.
3. I have not tested this app on any MIDI controllers.
4. This is an early access app, so it may be prone to bugs. Please report any bugs found on this Repo.

   Thanks! -Dooms
